		\currentwork
		{Developing Complex Electronic Data Capture Systems used in Clinical trails conducted by ATRI.}
		{Contribution in a Agile development methodology, from requirements definition through deployment. Using Atlassian JIRA and Confluence.}
		{Creating Restful API endpoints using Python(Django) and Django Rest framework.}
		{Developing the front-end to consume the API using AngularJS/HTML5/CSS}
		{Practicing test driven development to write unit tests, functional tests. Using continous integration (Travis Pro) extensively to run test build.}
		{Experience with Amazon Web Services (EC2, S3)}
		%%{Full Stack development of Electronic Data Capture System(EDC) used in Clinical trials of ATRI - USC.}{ Python (Django) and JavaScript (AngularJS) are the technologies and frameworks used to develop EDC.}
		%%{Test Driven Development is a basic practice followed by the Team. Experience with Github and active development tracking using Atlassian JIRA and Confluence. I have been using django's test suite and jasmine with lineman and grunt. The system uses git for version control and travis pro for continuous integration. Furthermore, Coveralls and istanbul is used to track the test coverage of system code.}
