		\workitems
		{Building a 32 node supercomputer cluster using the Nvidia Jetson TX1(Tegra). I have fully configured all the system to have password less access from the head node and also contributing for integration and networking of all the nodes. Future plans are to extend the cluster to a total of 64 nodes. }
		{Building another 40 node supercomputer cluster using x86-64 high end GPUs. I am in the process of installing Rocks Cluster Distribution( NPACI Rocks) on the supercomputer and also contributing to the integration and networking of all the nodes.}

		\subsubsection{Master's Thesis: Projects in GPU Computing with Performance and Benchmark Analysis.}
		\workitems
		{Successfully defended my Master's thesis. The objective was to benchmark an open parallel programming language OpenACC in terms of performance, portability and ease-of-use. Two heavy computation model in the field of Black hole physics - a Teukolsky equation and a Scalar Collapse code was used for the research. Finally, a case study on distributed computing with deep learning was also a part of my Master's thesis.}
